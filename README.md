# stranger-things-starting-point

We are going to be consuming another API, which is hosted at Stranger's Things API.

This one is different, in that it allows us to do more than request data... it also allows us to create data! In order to do this we will have to learn about CRUD (an acronym for Create, Read, Update, Destroy), how to improve our fetch game, and about user authentication via JSON Web Tokens (JWT).

By the end of this you'll have a deeper grasp of what we can do on the front end, and start to have an idea of what's going on inside of servers when we interact with them.
